			  <p class="pContent2">The Need
Learning to program is a required skill for the 21st century workforce. This is particularly important to students in junior and senior high school as they prepare to go to college and I believe learning the basics of computer programming, in this case, web programming, will be a helpful skill for these students to secure a 21st century career.
My goal and idea is to introduce students to the basics of HTML5 and CSS3, which are the basic programming language of the web. My multimedia will outline the benefits of learning to program websites and the benefit for the student’s life and career.<p>
 <p class="pContent2">A web programming learning activity will accompany each multimedia section.</p>
<h1>Goals, Objectives, Outcomes</h1>


<p class="pContent2">		   
The project will be hosted on a school server where it can be accessed by students and their teachers. It will also be responsive so that it can be viewed on desktop, tablets and mobile phones.
Evaluation
Student will be evaluated based on a basic understanding of HTML5 and CSS3 concept. They also have to present their three page web design that will be reviewed by their peers.
