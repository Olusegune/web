			  <h2 class="headlineWebDesign2">My Preferred Approach to Teaching and Learning</h2>
		     <p>Written By <a href="">Victor Olusegun A. Edun</a> | Date Published: 11/21/2017</p>
		      
			  
           <p class="pContent2">My preferred method of teaching and learning is the Constructivist theory. In the constructivist theory, students get to “construct” their own knowledge and understanding of the World, through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. Constructivist education approach encourages students to be active learners who are involved in their learning experience. They are often encouraged to solve a real world problem and share their findings.</p>
           <p class="pContent2">In a Constructivist seeing, my role as a teacher is not to spoonfeed my students but help them create, test their ideas and draw their own conclusions. I become a facilitator who scaffolds the process to keep students on task, direct their inquiry. I also provide feedback to help them improve their project. Constructivist classes make students active learners, not just passive knowledge. It also taps into innate human curiosity to find out how things work and to solve a problem.</p>p>

           <h1>How would you approach creating and managing an online course based on that theory?</h1>
           
           
           
<p class="pContent2">As a teacher in a constructivist environment, I would approach creating and managing an online course by:
1. Determine whether my classes will be synchronous or asynchronous or a blend of the two. Will my classes be at a particular time and day and in real-time?
2. To facilitate the process of students “constructing” their own knowledge and learning experience, I will facilitate social learning through students introducing themselves at the start of the class, by doing a collaborative fun activity and participating in discussion groups. A video post introducing themselves (as we did at the start of this class )will be a good start. In this way, they will be able to learn from each other and share knowledge and experiences.
3. I will provide the expectations of the class by providing clear rubrics for discussions, assignments, and deadline for projects/module.
4. Participate in discussions by creating posts. Students must not just agree or disagree with a post but state exactly why they do so.
    5. My online class will be a project and problem-based learning. I will encourage the students to solve the real world around them and then share that solution with the rest of the class for feedback.</p>

           
           <p class="pContent2"> I will provide feedback, inputs and provide scaffolding to keep students on task, on a project and on time.
How would you apply Adult Learning Theory in your online course and why is it important to understand?
Malcolm Knowles’ (1980) defines as andragogy is defined as “the art and science of helping adults learn” (Knowles et al., 1998, p.)
               Adults and children learn differently. Adults tend to:</p>
           
           
           
<p class="pContent2">1. Adults recognize the necessity of learning something before undertaking to learn it. Learning a new skill or knowledge is done with a clear end goal in mind: “ I want to get a promotion from being a factory floor supervisor to corporate by getting this MBA in Supply Chain management”. This makes them motivated learners who even though they have to juggle jobs, marriage, and jobs, find the commitment to get their assignments and classwork done in a timely manner. Knowing this means that i am working with people who are innately motivated. I use this knowledge to help them work towards achieving their specific goal.
2. Adults recognize that they are responsible for their own decisions – their own lives. Adults recognize that they are more or less in control of their life. They, therefore, learn a new skill or knowledge to take their life to the next level; eg improve income and quality of life, learn to paint or develop a side business. By understanding this, I can make sure that at the end of the course, students are able to learn the desired skills and produce a tangible artifact or product to share with the world. No one wants to pay for a course and end up not learning the desired skills.</p>
<p class="pContent2">3. Adults enter an educational experience with more and different experience than youths. Adults are, well, adults. They have deeper life experiences and have been to regular school and to the school of hard knocks. They are therefore older, wiser and make better decisions than they would if they are younger. This means they-they know about the subject. For example, in MIT 806, my classmates share their teaching experiences and struggles in the classroom, as a result, they are my invaluable learning resources. As an educator, i will leverage their knowledge by encouraging them to share it through discussion posts, comments etc.
4. Adults are more eager to learn things they must know and apply in order to cope effectively with their real-life situations. This means they want to be able to apply their new knowledge to solve a practical problem. For example, “ I want to be able to make a phone app” at the end of the class, the adult student must be able to say “ I made this phone app”. I will therefore design my class in such a way that at the end of the course, the student can produce a final artifact.
    5. Adults are life centered (or task centered or problem centered) in their orientation to learning. Adults have no time for fluff. They are not interested in a chock full of theory. They want to be able to solve a problem, make or build stuff. My classes will, therefore, be project and problem based so that they are able to apply their new found knowledge in practical ways and visible ways.</p>
           
           
<p class="pContent2">6. Adults also value tangible feedback, to know how they are doing in a class. That means feedback will be integrated into my online classes.
What do you see as the benefits of Project-Based Learning?
Project-based Learning is a method where students acquire skills by working on a complex problem or question often connected to a real life problem or challenge. The benefits of project-based learning include but is not limited to:
1. It helps create critical thinking and problem-solving ability, ability to work with others to achieve a specific goal: eg create a website, create a new business etc.
2. It tends to be practical and authentic. The adult student is not told to solve abstract mysteries like the ‘meaning of life” or ” The joy of basketweaving”rather, he is given resources and told to solve a particular real problem or create a final product and artifact. The sense of learning by creating something by myself is very fulfilling for these learners. (ISTE 1 A)
3. The student has control of the final project or product. Is it an e-commerce website or a medical app? He gets to choose the project to work on. This helps the student to be fully engaged and see the project to its logical conclusion.
4. Criticism. Students will give and receive criticism eg Oreo Cookie feedback, This helps them refine and improve the final product, just as feedback in the real world helps improve a project.
5. Student creates a final artifact or product to be shared with the public. The final product goes beyond the classroom. This makes students have a sense of accomplishment.
6. Reflection. The student gets to reflect on the project’s making, processes, experiences and other experience with the instructor, fellow students or with the public.
